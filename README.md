## User Stories

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [x] UI animations

## Notes

* Finished required portion of app relatively quickly but ran into some blocks while extending app functionality & design
* Got stuck on updating a UISegmentedControl with data from NSUserDefaults, but tinkered around and finally figured out how to set selected segment/customize UISegmentedControl
* Still unsure of best practice for animating views - I did manage to animate two views on one screen but it may not have been the optimal way to animate, or honestly the best design choice
* Also learned about:
    * How to set placeholder text for text fields!
    * How to access and use information about current locale!
    * Beginning to understand the idea behind outlets
* Found myself running into not just technical questions, but design questions - i.e. whatâ€™s the best way to let users customize their experience?
* What to improve: figure out how to use auto layout & constraints so that UI layout works with every kind of screen
